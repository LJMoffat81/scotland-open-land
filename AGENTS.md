# AGENTS.md — working on Scotland Open Land

## Product

Build the **open land information platform** described in [docs/PLATFORM.md](docs/PLATFORM.md).

That brief is the destination. Do not rewrite it to match whatever happens to be shipped today. The AGR engine is the core; ownership, cadastral, public-land and vacant-land layers are in scope.

Annual Ground Rent remains first: residual site value on a What3Words 3×3 m grid, SLRG methodology, public education UI.

## Do

- Follow [docs/PLATFORM.md](docs/PLATFORM.md) when choosing what to build next
- Prefer residual valuer logic and documented config
- Use only open or licensed data (see `docs/DATA_LICENSING.md`)
- Keep map residual vs national rent pool distinct
- Make data gaps visible (Sasine, private names, missing public registers)
- Add tests for valuation and data schema changes
- Preserve clarity UI: public £/year first, depth under tabs
- Keep AGR / scenario tools as the analytical centre when adding spatial layers

## Do not

- Shrink the platform brief to the current map-only feature set
- Scrape property portals (Zoopla, Rightmove, ESPC, …)
- Commit API keys or full paid datasets
- Present synthetic fixtures as real ROS sales in the UI
- Silently change signed-off `agr.yaml` defaults without notes
- Present research estimates as official valuations or tax bills
